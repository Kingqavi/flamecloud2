## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you notice a vunerability in the code, please either open a PR with a
fix, or make an issue so it can be fixed ASAP. If you find a serious
security vunerability, report it privately. Instructions on how to
do that are [here](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).
